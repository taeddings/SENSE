# Product Guidelines: SENSE v2

## 1. Core Message: Power and Performance

All external communication, documentation, and internal discussions should reflect the core message of SENSE v2: **Power and Performance**. We emphasize the framework's high-performance computing capabilities, advanced hardware optimizations, and its capacity to handle computationally intensive AI tasks. When describing the system, we prioritize its efficiency, speed, and the technical sophistication of its architecture.

## 2. Prose Style: Formal and Academic

The required prose style is **Formal and Academic**. This ensures that all written materials are precise, objective, and suitable for a technical audience, including researchers and engineers.

*   **Tone:** Maintain a formal, objective, and authoritative tone.
*   **Language:** Use precise, unambiguous technical language. Define terms clearly. Avoid colloquialisms, slang, and overly casual phrasing.
*   **Structure:** Organize documents logically with clear headings, sections, and citations where appropriate.
*   **Audience:** Assume the reader has a strong technical background in AI, machine learning, and software engineering.

## 3. Visual Identity (Code & Documentation)

The visual identity of the project is defined by its commitment to clarity, consistency, and professionalism in its code and documentation.

*   **Code Formatting:** A **strict and consistent** formatting style is mandatory. All code must adhere to a predefined linting and formatting guide (e.g., Black for Python). This non-negotiable rule ensures readability and maintainability.
*   **Documentation Formatting:** All documentation must follow a standardized template. This includes README files, API documentation, and the project wiki. Consistency in formatting helps users navigate and understand the project more easily.
*   **Diagrams and Figures:** All technical diagrams must be created using a consistent and professional style. They should be clear, well-labeled, and directly support the accompanying text.

## 4. Communication Style

*   **Internal:** Communication among team members should be direct, data-driven, and focused on technical merit. Discussions should be backed by evidence, such as performance benchmarks or links to source code.
*   **External:** When communicating with the community (e.g., in GitHub issues, forums), maintain the formal and academic tone. Be helpful and thorough, but avoid overly personal or casual conversation.

## 5. Decision Making

All technical decisions should be guided by the principle of maximizing **Power and Performance**.

*   **Evidence-Based:** Decisions on architecture, algorithms, and dependencies must be supported by empirical evidence, such as performance benchmarks, complexity analysis, and peer-reviewed research.
*   **Technical Merit:** The primary criterion for any technical choice is its ability to enhance the framework's performance, scalability, and efficiency.
